# JNJ6800_GUI-DB
LabVIEW/MySQL

In this project, I have designed and developed a PC software  based on NI LabVIEW/MySQL DB for Project JNJ6800. The main tasks includes:
1. Display real-time and historical data of rotating equipment vibration, speed, temperature and other measurement indicators;
2. Display the real-time signal waveform of the vibration sensor, perform FFT analysis on it, and provide a diagnosis opinion;
3. Communicate with the lower computer based on modbus-TCP/UDP protocol, configure the sensor parameters of the lower computer;
4. Develop MySQL database, store the data and configuration information sent by the lower computer, GUI accesses the database in real time, and processes SQL commands;
5. Write a software development manual;
